        <p>Gurjar Samrat Mihir Bhoj (c. 836-885 CE) was a powerful ruler of the Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty, expanding his vast empire across North India and safeguarding it from Arab incursions, reaching its zenith under his rule. Known as Ādivarāha, he was a devotee of Vishnu, patronized arts and learning, and established Kannauj as his capital, becoming a dominant force in the tripartite struggle with Palas and Rashtrakutas for control of India. His reign marked significant political stability, military strength, and cultural prosperity, leaving a lasting legacy as a legendary Indian emperor. 
Rise to Power & Empire Expansion
Mihir Bhoj succeeded his father, Ramabhadra, and inherited a strong kingdom. He was a masterful strategist and warrior, successfully conquering regions in Malwa and the Deccan, and pushing back Arab advances from Sindh, driving them out of Kachchh. His empire extended from the Himalayas to the Narmada River, and from Multan to Bengal, with Kannauj as its strategic center. 
Military Prowess & Diplomatic Skill
Mihir Bhoj was a formidable military leader, engaging in the Tripartite Struggle for Kannauj against the Palas and Rashtrakutas, emerging largely victorious. He was also a shrewd diplomat, securing suzerainty over several smaller kingdoms, including the Chandellas. His military victories and diplomatic acumen solidified the Pratihara dominance in Northern India, making him one of the most powerful rulers of his time. 
Cultural & Religious Patronage
A devout follower of Vishnu, Mihir Bhoj adopted the title Ādivarāha and featured this incarnation on his coins. He was a great patron of Sanskrit literature, art, and architecture, fostering a rich cultural environment. His court attracted scholars and poets, contributing to significant advancements in learning and arts, with grand temples and buildings commissioned during his reign. 
Legacy
Mihir Bhoj's reign (836-885 CE) represented the golden age of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, characterized by vast territorial control, military might, and cultural flourishing. His successful defense of India's northern frontiers against external threats and his consolidation of power established him as a legendary figure, remembered as the "most powerful ruler of India" by contemporary chroniclers like Sulaiman. His rule brought stability and prestige, cementing the Pratiharas as a major power in medieval India. </p>

            Mihira Bhoja (836-885 CE) or Bhoja I was a ruler of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty of India. He succeeded his father Ramabhadra. Bhoja was a devotee of Vishnu and adopted the title of Adivaraha which is inscribed on some of his coins. One of the outstanding political figures of India in ninth century, he ranks with Dhruva Dharavarsha and Dharmapala as a great general and empire builder. The origin of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty of India is a topic of debate among historians. The rulers of this dynasty used the self-designation “Pratihara” for their clan, but have been described as “Gurjara” by their neighbouring kingdoms. Only one particular inscription of a feudatory ruler named Mathanadeva mentions him as a “Gurjara-Pratihara”. Mihira Bhoja I's epithet was Srimad-Adivaraha (the fortunate primeval boar incarnation of Vishnu) and therefore there is a broad agreement amongst the scholars on the attribution of adivaraha drama billon coins to him. These coins have a depiction of Adivaraha on the obverse.
